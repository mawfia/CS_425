# IllEngine

In this class you will make your own game engine from scratch.

## Platform setup

The first thing we need is a compiler and build system. In this class, we will use [`xmake`](https://xmake.io/) as our build system.
`xmake` is simple, modern, cross-platform, and comes with a package manager.
There are [installation instructions](https://xmake.io/#/guide/installation) for many platforms.
On macOS, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install xmake`.
On Windows, you can use `winget` (or other options): `winget install xmake`.
On Linux, there are instructions for various flavors.

You also need a compiler.
On macOS, you should install `Xcode` with the `App Store`.
On Windows, install Visual Studio.
On Linux, install gcc or clang.

One you have a compiler and `xmake` installed, we are ready to begin.

## Making a project

Create a new directory. Since we're making a "little engine", I called mine `illengine` (ðŸ¤·).
Create a file `xmake.lua` and put the following inside:

```
add_rules("mode.debug", "mode.release")

set_policy("build.warning", true) -- show warnings
set_warnings("all") -- warn about many things

target("helloworld")
    set_kind("binary")
    set_languages("cxx17")

    add_files("demo/helloworld.cpp")
```

This declares that we want to support debug and release builds in general, and that we want to see lots of compiler warnings.
It also declares a target program named `helloworld`.
(It would have declared a library if instead of `binary` we had written `static` or `shared`.)
We want to use the C++17 standard.
This Hello, World! program will verify that your environment is working correctly.
Let's put the program in a `demo` directory. Create `demo/helloworld.cpp` and put the most basic C++ program inside:

```
#include <iostream>

int main( int argc, const char* argv[] ) {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
    return 0;
}
```

Then type `xmake` on the command line. Unless something has gone wrong, you should see something like:

```
[ 25%]: ccache compiling.release demo/helloworld.cpp
[ 50%]: linking.release helloworld
[100%]: build ok!
```

`xmake` puts the resulting program (`binary`) somewhere inside a new directory it creates (and manages) named `build`. You can run it directly (for me, it's `./build/macosx/arm64/release/helloworld`). It's easier to just ask `xmake` to run it for you with `xmake run helloworld`. This will print:

```
Hello, World!
```

Some useful `xmake` commands:

* `xmake run -d helloworld` launches the program in a debugger.
* `xmake f --menu` opens a command-line menu system you can use to switch between debug and release modes.
* `xmake f -m debug` and `xmake f -m release` directly switch between debug and release mode.
* `xmake watch` will re-run `xmake` automatically when any code changes. `xmake watch -r -t helloworld` will do the same and then run the `helloworld` target.

## Setting up version control

Before going any further, let's set up version control with git. You can use git on the command line or using your favorite git gui. Before we proceed with git, we need to create a `.gitignore` file at the top level of our project directory so we don't add build products or other extraneous files to our git repository. Put this inside:

```
# Xmake
/build
/.xmake

# macOS
.DS_Store
# Windows
Thumbs.db
```

Now you should initialize your git repository and make a first commit.

**You have reached the first checkpoint.** Upload your code. Run `xmake clean` and then zip your entire directory. Your directly tree should look like:

```
.git/
    ... lots of stuff
.gitignore
xmake.lua
demo/
    helloworld.cpp
```

## Starting your engine

It's time to start designing and building your game engine. We will work in the following order:

1. Create a window (the beginning of a `GraphicsManager`).
2. Create a game loop (the core of the `Engine`).
3. Detect input (`InputManager`).
4. Play sounds on keypress (`SoundManager` and `ResourceManager`).
5. Draw a textured square (most of the `GraphicsManager`).
6. Manage game objects (`EntityManager`).
7. Add scripting support (`ScriptManager`).

We'll put our engine source code in a new directory called `src` next to `demo`. Create a file named something like `Engine.h`. The `Engine.h` header will declare an `Engine` class that stores all of the various managers, starts them up, runs the game loop, and shuts the managers down. We will also need a new target in our `xmake.lua`, a library for our engine. Since I'm calling mine `illengine`, that's what I'm calling this target. Let's make it a `static` library, since those are usually less trouble. (Our operating system doesn't have to worry about finding them dynamically.)

```
target("illengine")
    set_kind("static")
    set_languages("cxx17")

    -- Declare our engine's header path.
    -- This allows targets that depend on the engine to #include them.
    add_includedirs("src", {public = true})

    -- Add all .cpp files in the `src` directory.
    add_files("src/*.cpp")
```

Let's make our `helloworld` target depend on `illengine` by adding the line `add_deps("illengine")` to it:

```
target("helloworld")
    set_kind("binary")
    set_languages("cxx17")

    add_deps("illengine")

    add_files("demo/helloworld.cpp")
```

## Digression on C++ Software Design

In this course you have a certain amount of architectural freedom. So long as you create the desired re-usable functionality, you can stray from the minor decisions I am recommending here.) In C++, the only difference between a `struct` and a `class` is that `struct` members are `public` by default, whereas `class` members are `private` by default. Which you choose is a matter of taste. Generally, I use `struct`s when I'm primarily grouping data together and classes when I want methods to execute close to some data. Be generous with `struct`s. You might organize the parameters to a function as a `struct`. The `struct` (and `class`) member variables can be declared with sensible defaults (e.g., `bool fullscreen = false;`).

Namespaces are another important organizing principle in modern C++. By wrapping your header declarations in a `namespace Foo { ... }`, you prevent accidental collisions. In my engine, all my headers have a `namespace illengine { ... }`. Inside a `.cpp` file or a function, you can write `using namespace Foo` to avoid having to prefix all your names with `Foo`. Where in C you might declare a static variable `static int global_thing;` in a `.c` file, in C++ you can declare an anonymous namespace `namespace { int global_thing; }` in a `.cpp` file for the same effect.

## Back to the Engine: Declaring Common Types

In any large software project, it's a good idea to make a header file containing common types. For example, you might create a file `Types.h` which declares what a real-number type and string type are throughout your project. For example:

```
#pragma once

#include <string>

namespace Foo {
    typedef double real;
    typedef std::string string;

    ...
}
```

You will need to `#include <string>` in order to have access to the C++ standard library's string type.

This header is also a good place for "forward declarations". Because C++ uses file-based compilation units rather than some kind of module system (that is, until the very recent C++20 standard), we need to be careful to avoid including the same header file multiple times. The easiest way to do this is by putting the line `#pragma once` at the top of every header file. While technically not standard, it's [supported by all the major C++ compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragma_once#Portability) and a lot less typing and redundancy than the [header guards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_guard) you may have seen in C or in C++ in the past. However, `#pragma once` won't solve circular dependency problems, where, for example, the `GraphicsManager` needs to know about the `ResourceManager` and vice versa. The solution is to partially declare a class in advance. Writing `class Engine;` in our `Types.h` file is enough to let the compiler know that there is an `Engine` class in the `Foo` namespace. The forward declaration satisfies the compiler enough to let us declare a pointer or reference to the `Engine`. Before we actually use the `Engine` in a `.cpp` file, we will have to include its header. (Another solution to circular dependencies is [`unique_ptr`](https://ortogonal.github.io/cpp/forward-declaration-and-smart-pointers/) and yet another is the so-called ["pimpl pattern"](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2017/09/22/make-pimpl-using-unique_ptr/).)

## What is the Engine?

The `Engine` class is actually quite small and simple. In fact, it could just be a nested namespace named `Engine`. Data-wise, it stores all the managers (they could be global variables or members of the `Engine` class). All the managers get a reference to the engine so they can access each other. It takes some basic parameters are input (size of the window, whether to go full-screen, etc.). `Engine::Startup()` calls `Startup()` on the managers in the right order. `Engine::Shutdown()` does the same. Finally, `Engine` needs a method to run the game loop. That function should take a callback so that the game can have a chance to run an update function each time through the loop. Here is pseudocode in class form for an engine with graphics and input managers:

```
class Engine:
    public:
        GraphicsManager graphics
        InputManager input

        def Startup( GameParameters ):
            graphics.Startup()
            input.Startup()

        def Shutdown():
            input.Shutdown()
            graphics.Shutdown()

        def RunGameLoop( UpdateCallback ):
            while( True ):
                input.Update()

                UpdateCallback()

                graphics.Draw()

                // Manage timestep
}
```

This is just pseudocode. Alternatively, your engine's `RunGameLoop()` could call `Startup()` at the beginning of the function and `Shutdown()` at the end. In that case, `RunGameLoop()` would need to take another callback function to let the user of your engine perform game setup between `Startup()` and the game loop itself.

You will also need to consider how the managers can access each other. Eventually, we will have even more managers. For this next checkpoint, you don't need to create an input manager. Fortunately, if the managers can access the engine, they can access each other. One possibility is to make an engine global variable. In C++17, you can declare it right in the engine header as an [inline variable](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47502744). For example, if your class were named `Foo`, you could declare `inline Foo gFoo`, where the `g` prefix is [Hungarian notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation).) If you are strongly allergic to global variables, the engine can instead pass a reference (or pointer) to itself to all the managers so that they can access each other. (You can do this in the constructor of Engine or in the Startup methods.)

Managing the time step means making sure that your game loop runs 60 times per second. The code inside the loop should take less than 1/60 of a second, so your engine needs to sleep until the next iteration ([tick](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/81608/what-is-a-tick-in-the-context-of-game-development) should start. (Handling slow downs is an [interesting topic](https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/).) You can manage the timestep using C++'s `std::this_thread::sleep_for()` and passing it a C++ `std::chrono::duration<>`. You can get a double-valued timer by calling `glfwGetTime()` (which you can subtract and create a `std::chrono::duration<double>` from). See below for how to include `GLFW`. You don't need GLFW for this. You can instead use the C++ standard library directly by subtracting two `std::chrono::time_point`s, which you can get via `std::chrono::steady_clock::now()`. For example, `const auto t1 = std::chrono::steady_clock::now()` stores the current time in a variable `t1`. For example, you can create a 0.1 second duration via `const auto one_tenth_of_a_second = std::chrono::duration<real>( 1./10. )`. You will need to `#include <thread>` and `#include <chrono>` to access the C++ standard library's functionality.

## The `GraphicsManager`

At this point, all we want from the graphics manager is to create a window. We will use [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) for this. It's an extremely lightweight graphics and input handling library. Declare your need for it at the top of your `xmake.lua` (just below the `add_rules()` line:

```
add_requires("glfw")
```

Inside `target("illengine")`, add it as a package:

```
    add_packages("glfw")
```

In your graphics manager C++ file, you will need to include the GLFW headers. You can do this in the implementation file only (the `.cpp` file). Users of your engine don't need to know that it uses GLFW to create a window. The engine is abstracting this detail! Since we are using `sokol_gfx` as our GPU API, we don't want GLFW to include any OpenGL headers directly for us. This is how to do it:

```
#define GLFW_INCLUDE_NONE
#include "GLFW/glfw3.h"
```

Here is a magic bit of code for your graphics manager's startup method to create a window and lock its aspect ratio:

```
glfwInit();
// We'll use sokol_gfx's OpenGL backend
glfwWindowHint( GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR, 3 );
glfwWindowHint( GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR, 3 );
glfwWindowHint( GLFW_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT, GLFW_TRUE );
glfwWindowHint( GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE, GLFW_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE );
GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow( window_width, window_height, window_name, window_fullscreen ? glfwGetPrimaryMonitor() : 0, 0 );
glfwSetWindowAspectRatio( window, window_width, window_height );
if( !window )
{
    std::cerr << "Failed to create a window." << std::endl;
    glfwTerminate();
}
glfwMakeContextCurrent( window );
glfwSwapInterval(1);
```

This code expects a few parameters: the `window_width` and `window_height`, a name for the window (`window_name`), and a boolean to specify whether the window should be fullscreen (`window_fullscreen`). You can hard-code some reasonable values or you can find a way to take parameters. You might store the parameters in a configuration `struct` in the `Engine`. The user can set them directly or pass it in to your engine's startup method. You may notice that this code snippet is asking for an OpenGL-compatible window. That's because we will use `sokol_gfx`'s OpenGL backend for cross-platform simplicity. Your graphics manager's shutdown only needs to call `glfwTerminate();`.

Finally, this is a good time to mention that I recommend a proper logging library rather than outputting to `std::cout` and `std::cerr`. You have a lot of options. I used [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog). That way I can do things like: `spdlog::error( "Failed to create a window." );` or `spdlog::info( "Calling UpdateCallback()." );`. To use spdlog, you have to include it (`#include "spdlog/spdlog.h"`) and add it to your `xmake.lua` (`add_requires("spdlog")` near the top and `add_packages("spdlog")` in your `illengine` target).

Modify `demo/helloworld.cpp` to start up your engine, run its main loop, and shut it down when the main loop terminates.

**You have reached the second checkpoint.** Commit your code to your git repository. Upload it for grading. Run `xmake clean` and then zip your entire directory. This checkpoint should contain:

* A graphics manager class that creates a window.
* A game engine class that starts up the graphics manager and runs a game loop 60 times per second. Your game engine won't take a user update callback yet.
* The modified `demo/helloworld.cpp`.

## Detecting input

It's time to create an input manager. The input manager provides an interface to the various input hardware state, such as which keyboard/mouse/joystick buttons are pressed and where the mouse or joystick is. Each time the game loop runs, the engine gives the input manager a chance to process input events (`input.Update()` in the pseudocode above). A fancy input manager lets users map physical actions (e.g. pressing a hardware button) to game actions. We will start with a simple input manager that just makes GLFW's input state available for querying by users of our engine. The input manager's `Update()` method only needs to call `glfwPollEvents();`. We will create a method called something like `KeyIsPressed` that takes a key name as a parameter and returns a boolean. It will be a thin wrapped around [`glfwGetKey()`](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.3/group__input.html#gadd341da06bc8d418b4dc3a3518af9ad2). You can make the key name an `int` and just pass it along directly to GLFW, or you can create your own `enum class` for key names that you expose to users. Your enum can choose the same numbers for keys as GLFW (see [here](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.3/group__keys.html); you can cast your `enum class` to an `int`). It is fine to simply ask users to use GLFW key names (e.g. `GLFW_KEY_LEFT`). In that case, your input manager header should also include the GLFW header, and your `xmake.lua` should change `add_packages("glfw")` to `add_packages("glfw", {public = true})`.

There isn't a perfect separation between the graphics manager and the input manager. The input manager needs to call GLFW functions and pass them the `GLFWwindow*` created by the graphics manager. This is why your Engine stores all the managersâ€”so they can access each other. Modify your graphics manager to store the `GLFWwindow*` as an instance variable. You can make it `private` and still let the input manager access it by writing `friend class InputManager;` anywhere inside your graphics manager class.

It's time to add a user update callback to your game engine. In C++, a reasonable type to use for the user's update callback is: `std::function<void(Engine&)>`. That is, the user's callback is a function that takes an `Engine&` as a parameter and doesn't return anything. If you have an `Engine` global variable, then you can just use `std::function<void()>`, which is a function that takes no parameters and returns nothing. You can typedef that and then use it as a parameter to your game loop. Example syntax:

```
typedef std::function<void()> UpdateCallback;
void RunGameLoop( const UpdateCallback& callback );
```

You will need to `#include <functional>` to access `std::function`. It's a general type that can take any kind of function a C++ user might want to pass. The user of your engine can create a [lambda](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda) function to pass, as in:

```
engine.RunGameLoop( [&]( Engine& ) {
    // code that will run inside the game loop
    } );
```

Modify your `helloworld` function to pass a callback when running your engine's main loop. The callback should print or log a message when at least one key of your choosing is pressed.

You may have noticed that there's no way to quit your program (without asking your operating system to terminate it, e.g., `^C`). Quitting is easy; you just break out of the main loop. The `RunGameLoop()` function will then return. You can do that in response to a key press like escape or Q. If you want to check if someone clicked the window's close box, call the GLFW function `glfwWindowShouldClose(window)`. You can set this programmatically with `glfwSetWindowShouldClose( window, true );`. You can design your own way to encapsulate those. It could be something like `GraphicsManager::ShouldQuit()` and `GraphicsManager::SetShouldQuit(true)` methods.

**You have reached the third checkpoint.** Upload your code. Run `xmake clean` and then zip your entire directory. For this checkpoint:

* Your engine should have an input manager that lets users detect key presses.
* Your engine should take a user callback to execute in its main loop.
* Your `demo/helloworld.cpp` should pass a callback that prints or logs a message when a key is pressed.
* Your program should terminate when someone clicks the close box.

## The Sound Manager

It's easier (much less code) to play sounds than draw graphics to the screen, so we'll warm up with a sound manager. We will use [SoLoud](https://sol.gfxile.net/soloud/) as our sound library. It has a really nice C++ API. (Click the link! Look at the sample code!) Unfortunately, it's not in the `xmake` package repository `xrepo`, but it's easy enough to create a one-off xmake package for an external library. Download this [`external/xmake_soloud.lua`](external/xmake_soloud.lua) file and put it in an `external` directory. Load it into your `xmake.lua` file by adding

```
includes("external/xmake_soloud.lua")
```

near the top. We can then write `add_requires("soloud")` after that line and `add_packages("soloud")` in our engine target. (You will need to do `add_packages("soloud", {public = true})` if your sound manager header includes a SoLoud header.)

Let's wrap SoLoud in a sound manager class. The sound manager will contain an instance of `SoLoud::Soloud`. (Yes, the capitalization is different for the namespace and the class.) You'll need to `#include "soloud.h"`. The startup method must call `.init()` and the shutdown method must call `.deinit()` on the `SoLoud::Soloud` instance. More interesting, let's add a method to load, destroy, and play a sound. We will follow a similar pattern for all of our resources (sounds, images, scripts). The load function will always have a signature like:

```
void LoadSound( const string& name, const string& path );
```

This lets our engine's users load a sound and then access it by a convenient name in the destroy and play methods. Loading a sound in SoLoud is easy. We need to instantiate an instance of `SoLoud::Wav`, and then we can call the method `.load( path.c_str() );` on it. Keeping track of the `name` is easy, too. Let's use an [`std::unordered_map< string, SoLoud::Wav >`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map) as our name-to-sound map. With a map like that (I'll call it `m`, but you should call it something better), we can write `m[ name ].load( path.c_str() );`. That's it! An `std::unordered_map` will instantiate the `SoLoud::Wav` if it doesn't already exist when looking up the value for a key. (If you'd like to know in advance, you can use `m.count( name ) == 0` to check if `m` already has a sound by that name. In C++20, that will shorten to `m.contains( name )`.) Destroying the sound is also easy: `m.erase( name );`. Finally, playing a sound is as simple as telling our `SoLoud::Soloud` instance to `.play( m[ name ] )`.

Go ahead and load a sound and play it in response to a key changing from not pressed to pressed. (If you play it **if** the key is pressed, you'll play the sound many timesâ€”every 1/60 of a secondâ€”until the key is released.)

## Resources and the Resource Manager

Our resource management needs are pretty basic. We will create an `assets` directory to organize all the things that we'll want to access from our game. Modern build systems (like cmake and xmake) perform out of source builds, which means that the executable will be created in a funky location in some separate build directory. Since we'll want to load files from the `assets` directory, we'll need to tell xmake to copy `assets` next to the executable. Add the following snippet to `xmake.lua` somewhere inside the `target("helloworld")`:

```
    -- Copy assets
    after_build(function (target)
        cprint("Copying assets")
        os.cp("$(projectdir)/assets", path.directory(target:targetfile()))
    end)
```

At this point, reading a file from a path like `assets/sounds/coin.wav` should just work from your engine. This is what we assumed above for the sound manager. For the most straightforward cases, we could skip creating a resource manager altogether. However, it's a good idea to centralize our path handling. For that, you can make a resource manager that simply provides a method that resolves paths. The method would take in a partial path and return a path to a real file. Our `xmake.lua` will copy assets so that paths like `assets/sounds/coin.wav` just work, so the most basic resource manager would have a resolve path method that simply returns its input. You should create at least this resource manager now, and then modify your sound manager to call resolve on `path` before calling `SoLoud::Wav::load()`. A better resource manager would have a method to set the path root (it could default to `assets` or not) which could let users resolve `sounds/coin.wav`. Use [std::filesystem::path](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/path) to append `path` to the root path. Even fancier resource managers could do more. Some possibilities:

* Take in a URI, download the linked file, and then return the path to the download file or the file loaded into memory directly. Our sound and graphics and scripting libraries can load from files on disk (via a path) or from files already in memory.
* Load files to memory asynchronously. Either provide a way for the user to check later if the data is ready, or else let them provide a callback when it is. This would allow resources to be loaded in parallel and could drastically speed up game launch.

**You have reached the fourth checkpoint.** Upload your code. Run `xmake clean` and then zip your entire directory. For this checkpoint:

* Your engine should have a sound manager that lets users load and play sounds.
* Your engine should have a resource manager you use to resolve paths, even if it returns those paths unchanged.
* Your `demo/helloworld.cpp` should pass a callback that plays a sound when a key is pressed.
